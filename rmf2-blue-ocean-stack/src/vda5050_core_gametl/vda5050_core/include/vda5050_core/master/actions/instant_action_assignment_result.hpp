// Returned by VDA5050Master::assign_instant_actions. Synchronous,
// caller-visible outcome of an FMS attempt to dispatch instantActions to a
// specific AGV. Mirrors the AssignmentResult / AssignmentDecision shape from
// #15 but is intentionally a separate type:
//   - The order side carries stitch-specific decisions (STITCH_REJECTED /
//     STITCH_QUEUED) that have no instant-actions analog.
//   - The instant side will gain conflict-specific decisions in #22
//     (CONFLICTS_WITH_ACTIVE_ORDER, etc.) that don't apply to orders.
// Keeping the enums separate avoids polluting either API as both grow.
//
// On ASSIGNED, the actions have been handed off to the AGV's outbound queue;
// the validator chain (#23 schema, #16 PreSend, #12 traversability
// capability) still runs asynchronously on the queue-processor thread as
// defense-in-depth.
