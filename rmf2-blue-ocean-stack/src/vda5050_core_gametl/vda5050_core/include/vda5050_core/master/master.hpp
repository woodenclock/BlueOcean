/**
 * @brief VDA5050 Master for multi-AGV fleet management
 *
 * This abstract base class manages VDA5050 communication for multiple AGVs
 * using a single shared MQTT client that creates protocol adapters for each AGV.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Single shared MQTT client that creates protocol adapters for each AGV
 * - AGV onboarding/offboarding with allow list
 * - Message routing based on topic parsing
 * - Protocol adapters for subscribing and publishing to AGVs
 *
 * Thread safety note: Callbacks are invoked on the MQTT client thread.
 * If thread safety is required, the callback implementation should handle
 * synchronization (e.g., using a mutex).
 *
 * Construction requirement: VDA5050Master MUST be constructed via
 * `std::make_shared<MyMaster>(...)`. Each onboarded AGV stores a
 * `std::weak_ptr<VDA5050Master>` back-pointer (populated via
 * `weak_from_this()`) and uses it to dispatch incoming messages to the
 * master's virtual callbacks. `weak_from_this()` only returns a valid
 * weak_ptr if the master is currently inside a `shared_ptr` — stack-
 * allocated or `unique_ptr`-managed masters silently no-op on user
 * callbacks.

   * `STATE_UNKNOWN` and the pre-send validator chain will now
   * hard-reject orders queued for this AGV. This virtual is the
   * FMS reaction surface — alert operators, page on-call, kick
   * off recovery probes, etc. Default impl is empty.
   *
   * The library does NOT auto-cancel pending orders on this event
   * (state silence is potentially transient — AGV power-cycle,
   * broker reconnect, network blip). FMS overrides that want
   * aggressive cancellation can call
   * `AGV::cancel_pending_orders()` here. Compare with
   * `on_connection_broken`, which IS auto-cancelled because TCP
   * last-will is a hard signal.
   *
   * Threading: invoked on the HeartbeatListener's monitor thread.
   * Override must be thread-safe with respect to any state it
   * touches.
